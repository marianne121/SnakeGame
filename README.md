<h3> Summary </h3>
Despite the known bugs and possible future extension ideas, given the way this current program is written,
it would be difficult to implement some of the fixes. These learning points will be brought over to
future games written. That's all for the first game written in Java and the first attempt
in creating a GUI using Java :D
